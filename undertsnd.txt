Got it — here’s the **7-line max explanation**:
"""setting.py""""
1. `settings.py` stores all important configuration in one place.
2. Other files import it to access API keys, model names, and paths.
3. It prevents hardcoding values inside agents or services.
4. Makes the project easier to maintain and change later.
5. Keeps file paths and thresholds consistent everywhere.
6. Ensures the system doesn’t break if something changes.
7. It’s the foundation every other file depends on.

🟩 2. The flow is ALWAYS:
(1) PDF Extraction
↓

(2) Enrichment Agent → creates structured information
↓

(3) Validation Agent → compares CSV vs enriched
↓

(4) QA Agent → assigns confidence scores
↓

(5) Directory Agent → writes final CSV
This is exactly how EY’s reference workflow works.

"""
agents/data_validation_agent.py  (Option 4)

Advanced Data Validation Agent — CSV + PDF fusion + phonenumbers + combined confidence.

Features:
- Merge CSV (optional) and PDF-extracted JSON (optional).
- Normalize fields (name, phone, email, address, qualifications, registration).
- Use phonenumbers library (if installed) for phone validation; graceful fallback otherwise.
- Compute source_confidence (CSV vs PDF matching), format_confidence (regex/lib-based),
  and final_combined_confidence = source_confidence * format_confidence (configurable).
- Produce validation_flags, missing_fields, field_confidence (component scores) and overall_confidence.
- Atomic write into data/processed/validated_data.json (same path as before).
- CLI runner and a quick `self_test()` helper.

Usage examples:
    python -m agents.data_validation_agent SAMPLE1 --extracted path/to/extracted.json --csv path/to/csv_row.json --show

Google Maps Enrichment Service (Enterprise-Ready)
-------------------------------------------------
Core Responsibilities:
- Clinic existence check (Place Search)
- Address normalization (Geocoding)
- Phone & website extraction (Place Details)
- Confidence scoring
- Evidence / proof link generation
- Fuzzy address matching
- Highly fault-tolerant & retry-safe

NOTE:
This module NEVER mutates provider records.
It only returns structured enrichment data to the Enrichment Agent.
