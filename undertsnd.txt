Got it — here’s the **7-line max explanation**:
"""setting.py""""
1. `settings.py` stores all important configuration in one place.
2. Other files import it to access API keys, model names, and paths.
3. It prevents hardcoding values inside agents or services.
4. Makes the project easier to maintain and change later.
5. Keeps file paths and thresholds consistent everywhere.
6. Ensures the system doesn’t break if something changes.
7. It’s the foundation every other file depends on.
